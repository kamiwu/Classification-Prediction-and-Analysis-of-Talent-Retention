</br></br>In this project, we conducted class probability estimation by using **decision tree, knn and logistic regression**. We utilized **grid search, fitting curve, learning curve, cross-validation, ROC curve** and other modeling techniques using Python. I was responsible for the data cleaning, data exploration and modeling of knn.
